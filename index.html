        <p>Hi, my name is Amy Michelle Rellora, and Im from the Philippines. Im
            happily married to my wonderful husband, Dondie, and together we are
            blessed with three amazing children named Rain, Rock, and River. Being a
            mom is one of my greatest joys, and I also love spending time in the
            kitchen, cooking and creating meals that bring my family together.
        </p>

        <p>
            Im very excited to be part of this class and to continue growing my
            knowledge and skills. I have a strong background in Accounting and
            earned my Bachelors degree in Applied Business Management, which has
            helped me develop a love for organization, problem-solving, and working
            with numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Working at an accounting software company has introduced me to the world
            of software development, and being surrounded by talented developers
            inspires me every day. My goal is to better understand their language so
            I can provide stronger support to our customers, collaborate more
            effectively with my team, and bridge the gap between technical solutions
            and client needs. Combining my accounting expertise with new technical
            skills excites me, and I look forward to applying what I learn in
            meaningful ways.</p>
